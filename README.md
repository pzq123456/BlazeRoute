# BlazeRoute (Grid based routing algorithm for file spreading)

BlazeRoute is a grid based routing algorithm for file spreading. It is designed to spread files across a network of nodes in a way that minimizes the number of hops required to reach a target node. The algorithm is based on the concept of a grid, where each node is assigned a unique coordinate in the grid. The algorithm then calculates the shortest path between the source and target nodes using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. The algorithm is designed to be efficient and scalable, and can be used in a variety of applications, such as peer-to-peer file sharing networks, content delivery networks, and distributed storage systems.
